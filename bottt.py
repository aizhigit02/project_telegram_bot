Today, Aston Martin is rolling off such car models as the Cygnet (micro-car), the sporty V8 Vantage, the powerful DB9, DB11 and Vanquish, the Rapide S sports sedan, and the recently unveiled Valkyrie supercar with a hybrid powertrain (planned to release 150 cars at a price of £ 2.5 million).

            Popular models of the brand were such cars as Chevrolet Bel Air, Corvette, Impala, Malibu, Camaro, Monte Carlo, Chevrolet Suburban, Blazer, Silverado pickups. 
            Chevrolet cars appeared in Ukraine due to the connection of the American brand with the Korean company Daewoo. Among the models on our market, the most recognizable cars are: Aveo, Lacetti, and Chevrolet Niva.'''

The company is headquartered in Paris. André Citroën began his activity with the production of gears for locomotive engines and other similar parts. The gears had a special conical shape and it is they who are depicted on the company logo. The entrepreneurial Citroen was interested in various mechanical devices, and after a visit to the Ford plant in the United States, together with partner Jules Salomon, he founded production and in 1919 began producing cars, setting out to himself the goal of producing 100 cars daily and making them affordable and massive. The first production car of the brand was Citroën A with a 1.3-liter 10 hp engine. The affordable machine was a huge success in the market, which contributed to the further development of the company and the expansion of the model range. In 1934, Citroën introduced the Traction Avant, which later became a bestseller in the European market and was produced until 1957. At one time, Citroën H Van, 2CV, DS, and CX, BX were also popular. Some models of the brand, like the last three, were equipped with hydropneumatic suspension. Citroën began producing taxis in the early 1920s, and ten years later, its logo was on nine out of ten taxis in Paris. Another interesting fact from the history of the brand: Citroën DS-19, released in 1968, had turning headlights. And André Citroën was the first to "light up" the Eiffel Tower, equipping it with 125 thousand bulbs for his advertising. The seventies distinguished Citroën with financial difficulties and two alliances: first with Fiat, and then with Peugeot. At the same time, in 1976, the company cut ties with its main investor, tire giant Michelin. Citroën has a sports division called Citroën Racing. The factory team won the rally-raid championship five times in a row in 1993-1997. Citroën has four Dakar Rally wins, eight WRC championship cups and numerous off-road races.

The founder of the company, Soichiro Honda, started his activities in his own garage for the production of piston rings. The impetus for the development of the company was a large order from Toyota. Soichiro used the profits to develop and manufacture motorcycles. In 1950, Honda engineers introduced a four-stroke engine that had twice the power of its counterparts of the same size. This provided the company's products with explosive popularity and after 4 years, Honda motorcycles occupied 15% of the market in Japan, and by the end of the decade, the brand's two-wheelers had won all the most prestigious motorcycle races in the world. This achievement allowed the company's products to expand beyond Japan. In 1964, every second motorcycle sold in the United States was Honda, and three years later the firm became the largest motorcycle manufacturer in the world. Production of Honda cars began in 1963 with the Honda T360 pickup truck and the Honda S500 sports car. However, the real breakthrough in the automotive market for the company was the release of a model called the Civic in 1973. The Accord model, which appeared in the 76th, helped consolidate the company's success, especially in the United States. In 1986, Honda began developing and manufacturing robots. Until now, the company's engineers have already created several generations of humanoid robots, the last of which are known as ASIMO (Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility).

After a series of unsuccessful experiments in the 1970s, the designers of the concern developed a line of practical and attractive models that remain the basis of the model range to this day: Golf, Polo and Passat. Today, crossovers are also popular; in the Volkswagen model range, they are becoming more and more every year. The Volkswagen Group is currently one of the world's largest car manufacturers. In addition to the Volkswagen car brand itself, the Volkswagen AG group includes such car brands as Audi, Bentley, Bugatti,'''

The headquarters is located in the city of Gothenburg. Until 1999, the company belonged to the Ford Motor Company, and in 2010 it became the property of the Chinese concern Geely Holding Group. The founders gave their joint company the name Volvo, which is Latin for "roaming", that is, "food". The symbol, which is the logo of the brand, is the symbol of Mars, the alchemical designation of iron, and also the sign of male nature. Volvo cars have always been valued for their reliability, durability and safety. Back in the 1980s, the company began to bring safety issues to the fore in cars, eventually making it its main selling point. In 1999, Volvo became the property of the Ford corporation, the Americans gained control of the Volvo brand for passenger cars, minivans, sports cars and minibuses, and the Swedes retained the rights to use the brand for other activities. The following year, Volvo signed an agreement with Renault to create a joint truck company. This makes Volvo the largest truck manufacturer in Europe and one of the largest in the world. In the late 1990s, Volvo began offering high-performance versions of its cars with tweaks from motorsport engineering firm Polestar. In 2015, Volvo bought out Polestar and since then the hot line has become a must in the manufacturer's range. Volvo sold 571,577 vehicles in 2017,'''
